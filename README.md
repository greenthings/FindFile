# Problem 
I had to find my resume file i wrote in the past, but I didn't know where it was and saved it in a folder containing a lot of files.<br>
The speed of finding this was too slow.<br>
So, I created a program using Python, which can calculate fast speed. <br>
If you are in the same situation as me, I hope you will use this program to quickly find out if there is a file you want. <br>
As a result, I hope you save time.

# Solve
