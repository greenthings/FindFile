# Problem 
I had to find my resume file, but I didn't know where it was and saved it in a folder containing a lot of files.
The speed of finding this was too slow.
So, I created a program using Python, which can calculate fast speed. 
If you are in the same situation as me, I hope you will use this program to quickly find out if there is a file you want. 
As a result, I hope you save time.
